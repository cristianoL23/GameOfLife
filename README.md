# GameOfLife
My version of Conway's Game of Life (2AA4 Final Assignment)

In order to run the program create a file called boardload.txt in the experiment folder. 
The proper file format can be seen in the current boardload.txt.
The file can be any sized square. The zeroes represent dead cells and the ones are living cells.

In order to see what happens to the cells, run using the command "make experiment"
